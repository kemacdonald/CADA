Type of learning,Change in learning process ,Proposed mechanism,Example papersSocial,Enhanced attention and memory ,The presence of social partners makes information more salient and more likely to be learned,Social,Better information ,Social partners tune input to learner's current cognitive state,Social,More restrictive Inferences and generalization ,Psychological reasoning leads to stronger inferences. Information presented in social contexts is more likely to generalize,Active,Enhanced memory,"Active behaviors engage a range of basic memory mechanisms such as encoding of distinctive sensorimotor associations, coordination of selective attention and encoding, and enhanced metacognitive monitoring",Active,Better information,"Learner have access to prior knowledge, current hypotheses, and ability level, which they can leverage to create more helpful learning contexts",Active ,Less restrictive inferences and generalization,"In these cases, self-directed learners might at first default to a weak sampling assumption. Weak sampling implies less restrictive generalization because the sampling process itself conveys no information about the to-be-learned concept.",
