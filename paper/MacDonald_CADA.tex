\abstract{Children's rapid conceptual development is one of the more remarkable
features of human cognition. How do they learn so much so quickly?
Social learning theories argue for the importance of learning from more
knowledgeable others. In contrast, active learning accounts focus on
children's learning via exploration and the testing of hypotheses. In
this paper, I argue that an important step towards a complete theory of
human learning is to understand how active learning behaviors unfold
within fundamentally social learning contexts. To integrate the two
accounts, I use a framework of rational decision making that emphasizes
the role of utility (i.e., costs and benefits of an action) for
explaining choice behavior. The key insight is that social learning is
not separate from active learning, and the costs/benefits of children'
decisions about what to learn are shaped by interactions with other

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Human learning is remarkable. Consider that children, despite striking
limitations in their general processing capabilities, are able to
acquire new concepts at a high rate eventually reaching an adult
vocabulary ranging between 50,000 to 100,000 words (P. Bloom, 2002). And
they do this while also developing motor skills, learning social norms,
and building causal knowledge. What sorts of processes can account for
children's prodigious learning abilities?

Social learning theories offer a solution by pointing out that children
do not solve these problems on their own. And although children learn a
great deal from observation, they are typically surrounded by parents,
other knowledgeable adults, or older peers -- all of whom likely know
more than they do. These \emph{social} contexts can bootstrap learning
via several mechanisms. For example, work on early language acquisition
shows that social partners provide input that is tuned to children's
cognitive abilities (Eaves Jr, Feldman, Griffiths, \& Shafto, 2016;
Fernald \& Kuhl, 1987), that guides children's attention to important
features in the world (Yu \& Ballard, 2007), and that increases levels
of arousal and sustained attention, which lead to better learning (P. K.
Kuhl, 2007; Yu \& Smith, 2016).

Social contexts can also change the computations that support children'
learning from evidence. Recent work on both concept learning and causal
learning suggests that the presence of another person leads the learner
to reason about \emph{why} people perform certain actions. The key
insight is that knowledge of the underlying process that generates
information allows learners to make more appropriate inferences to
facilitate learning (Bonawitz \& Shafto, 2016; Frank, Goodman, \&
Tenenbaum, 2009; Shafto, Goodman, \& Griffiths, 2014). For example,
people will draw different inferences from the same observations
depending on whether they think that the behavior was accidental or
intentional. Moreover, adults and children will make even stronger
inferences if they think an action was selected with the goal to help
them learn (i.e., teaching) (Shafto, Goodman, \& Frank, 2012).

However, children are not passive recipients of information -- from
people or from the world. Instead, children actively select behaviors
(e.g., ask questions, choose where to allocate attention) that modulate
the content, pacing, and sequence of information they receive. In fact,
recent theorizing and empirical work in cognitive development
conceptualizes early learning as an active process of exploration and
hypothesis testing similar to the scientific method (Gopnik, Meltzoff,
\& Kuhl, 1999; Schulz, 2012). Moreover, recent empirical work across a
variety of domains (education, machine learning, and cognitive science)
has begun to explore the benefits of self-directed choice for speeding
learning outcomes via an increase in attention/arousal (CITE) during
learning or by providing better information that is more tightly linked
to the learners' cognitive state and interests (Castro et al., 2009; D.
B. Markant \& Gureckis, 2014; Settles, 2012).

Thus, both social and active contexts can facilitate learning by
engaging distinct learning processes and by providing the learner with
better information. But real-world learning involves a complex mixture
of these processes that unfolds over multiple timescales. One important
challenge for understanding human learning is to precisely characterize
the mutual influence of social learning contexts and children's
developing ability to exert control over their environment. In this
paper, I argue that learning from social contexts can be productively
construed as providing opportunities for \emph{constrained active
learning}. The key insight is that the presence of other people can
qualitatively change the cost-benefit calculus of learners' choices,
which in turn shapes children's input and the subsequent social context.

The plan for the paper is as follows. I first review evidence of the
effects of social learning across a variety of learning domains. I also
present three different mechanisms through which social contexts
facilitate learning: attentional, informational, and inferential. In
part II, I discuss work on active learning that explores the influence
of giving people control over the learning environment. In part III, I
integrate the social and active learning accounts using ideas from
formal models of decision making that emphasize the utility structure of
different actions available to the learner. I conclude by presenting a
conceptual analysis that explores the utility of a variety of choice
behaviors available to young learners in real-world social learning
contexts.

\section{Part I: Learning from other
people}\label{part-i-learning-from-other-people}

Children's conceptual development is faster and more flexible than any
other species. Why is this the case? Social learning theories argue that
a key factor is humans' unique capacity to transmit and acquire
information from other people.\footnote{In this paper, I define
  ``social'' contexts as learning environments where another agent is
  present. This definition includes a broad range of social learning
  behaviors: e.g., observation, imitation, and learning from direct
  pedagogy.} One of the primary benefits of this cultural learning
process is that learners gain access to knowledge that has accumulated
over many generations: information that would be far too complex for any
individual to figure out on their own (Boyd, Richerson, \& Henrich,
2011). Moreover, social contexts can facilitate learning because more
knowledgable others can select input to best support children's learning
(Kline, 2015; Shafto et al., 2012), providing learning opportunities
filled with generalizable information (Csibra \& Gergely, 2009).

A large body of empirical work on children's learning shows the effect
of social contexts on a variety of learning domains. However, these
effects manifest through different pathways such as guiding attention,
increasing arousal, selecting better information, and changing the
strength of children's inferences. In this section, I review the
evidence supporting the role of each of these social learning processes,
with the goal of synthesizing the different explanations for the
benefits of social learning.

\subsubsection{Social interactions enhance
attention}\label{social-interactions-enhance-attention}

From infancy humans preferentially attend to social information. For
example, newborn infants prefer to look at face-like patterns compared
to other configurations (Johnson, Dziurawiec, Ellis, \& Morton, 1991)
and will even show a preference for faces that make direct eye contact
compared to faces with averted gaze (Farroni, Csibra, Simion, \&
Johnson, 2002). In the auditory domain, newborns prefer to listen to
speech over non-speech (Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2007), their mother's
voice over other voices (DeCasper, Fifer, Oates, \& Sheldon, 1987), and
infant-directed speech over adult-directed speech (Cooper \& Aslin,
1990; Fernald \& Kuhl, 1987; Pegg, Werker, \& McLeod, 1992). Moreover,
recent work by Yu \& Smith (2016) used head-mounted eye trackers to
record parent-child interactions and found that one-year-olds will
sustain visual attention to an object longer when their parents' had
previously looked at that object.

These attentional biases lead to different outcomes in social learning
contexts. For example, 4-month-olds' show better memory for faces if
that face gazed directly at them as compared to a face with averted gaze
(Farroni, Massaccesi, Menon, \& Johnson, 2007). 4-month-olds' memory for
objects is enhanced if an adult gazed at that object during learning
(Cleveland, Schug, \& Striano, 2007; Reid \& Striano, 2005). And
7-month-olds more easily segment words from infant-directed speech
compared to adult-directed speech (Thiessen, Hill, \& Saffran, 2005).

P. K. Kuhl (2007) refer to these effects as ``social gating'' phenomena
since the presence of another person activates or enhances children's
computational learning mechanisms. One particularly striking piece of
evidence for the social gating hypothesis comes from P. K. Kuhl, Tsao,
\& Liu (2003)`s study of infants' foreign-language phonetic learning. In
this experiment, 9-10 month-old English-learning infants listened to
Mandarin speakers either via live interactions or via audiovisual
recordings and their ability to discriminate Mandarin-specific phonemes
was assessed two months later. Only the infants who were exposed to
Mandarin within social interactions were able to succeed on the phonetic
discrimination task and infants in the audiovisual recording condition
showed no evidence of learning. P. K. Kuhl et al. (2003) also provided
evidence that infants in the social interaction condition showed higher
rates of visual attention to the speaker, suggesting that the social
contexts enhanced learning by increasing children's attention to the
input.

The common thread across these findings is that the presence of another
person is a particularly good way to increase attention. In this model,
social input becomes more salient and therefore more likely to come into
contact with children's general learning mechanisms. However, increases
in arousal, attention, and memory are only one way that social contexts
can influence learning. In fact, one of the defining features of early
learning environments is the presence of other people who know more than
the child. This creates opportunities for more knowledgable others to
select learning experiences that are particularly beneficial -- either
because the information is tuned to children's current cognitive
abilities or because the information is likely to be generalizable.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Social interactions provide ``good''
information}{Social interactions provide good information}}\label{social-interactions-provide-good-information}

The notion that children's input might be shaped to facilitate their
learning is a key tenet of several influential theories of cognitive
development (e.g., Vygotsky's \emph{Zone of Proximal Development}
(Vygotsky, 1987), Rogoff's \emph{Guided Participation} (Rogoff et al.,
1993), and Csibra \& Gergely's \emph{Natural Pedagogy} (Csibra \&
Gergely, 2009)). But how do social interactions provide particularly
useful information for children's learning?

A particularly compelling set of evidence comes from studies of how
caregivers alter the way they communicate with young children. That is,
adults do not speak to children in the same way as they speak to other
adults; instead, they exaggerate prosody, reduce speed, shorten
utterances, and elevate both pitch and affect (for a review, see
(Fernald \& Simon, 1984)). And subsequent empirical work has shown that
these features of ``infant-directed speech'' facilitate vowel learning
(Adriaans \& Swingley, 2017; De Boer \& Kuhl, 2003), word segmentation
(Fernald \& Mazzie, 1991; Thiessen et al., 2005), word recognition
(Singh, Nestor, Parikh, \& Yull, 2009), and word learning (Graf Estes \&
Hurley, 2013).

Work on infants' early vocal production also provides evidence for the
importance social feedback, highlighting the feature of
\emph{contingency}. For example, Goldstein \& Schwade (2008) measured
whether infants modified their babbling to produce more speechlike
sounds after interacting with caregivers who either provided contingent
or non-contingent responses to infants' babbling. They found that only
infants in the contingent feedback condition changed their vocalization
behavior to produce more adult-like language forms. Goldstein \& Schwade
(2008) hypothesized that the contingency effect was driven by infants'
receiving input that was particularly useful for solving this learning
problem since the feedback was close in time to infants' vocalizations,
making it easier for them to compare discrepancies between the two.

A third piece of evidence comes from research on children's early word
learning. Social-pragmatic theories of language acquisition have
emphasized the importance of social cues for reducing the (in principle)
unlimited amount of referential uncertainty present when children are
trying to acquire novel words (P. Bloom, 2002; Clark, 2009; Hollich et
al., 2000). Empirical work by Yu \& Smith (2012) shows that young
learners tend to retain words that are accompanied by clear referential
cues, which serve to make a single object dominant in the visual field
(see also (Yu \& Smith, 2013; Yu, Ballard, \& Aslin, 2005). Moreover,
correlational studies show positive links between early vocabulary
development and parents' tendency to refer to objects that children are
already attending to (i.e., ``follow-in'' labeling) (Tomasello \&
Farrar, 1986).

In addition to being easier to learn, information acquired in social
contexts is also more likely to generalize and be useful beyond the
current learning context. Csibra \& Gergely (2009) argue that this
assumption of \emph{generalizability} is a fundamental component of
``Natural Pedagogy'' -- a uniquely human communication system that
allows adults to efficiently pass along cultural knowledge to children.
Experimental work testing predictions from this account shows that
children are biased to think that information presented in communicative
contexts is generalizable (Butler \& Markman, 2012; Yoon, Johnson, \&
Csibra, 2008), and corpus analyses provide evidence that generic
language (e.g., ``birds fly'') is common in everyday adult-child
conversations (Gelman, Goetz, Sarnecka, \& Flukes, 2008).

Thus far, I have reviewed evidence showing that social information can
benefit learning because it (a) enhances attention, (b) it has features
that make it easier to learn, and (c) it is likely to be useful beyond
the current learning context. Learning from other people also changes
learning by engaging distinct social reasoning processes that change how
learners interpret and learn from evidence.

\subsubsection{Social interactions change inferential
learning}\label{social-interactions-change-inferential-learning}

Perhaps one of the defining features of human social learning is that
teachers and learners' actions are not random. Instead, people select
behaviors with respect to some goal (e.g., to communicate a concept),
and learners reason about \emph{why} someone chose to perform a
particular action. The key point is that this reciprocal process of
reasoning about others' goal-directed actions can change how people
interpret superficially similar behaviors, altering the learning
process.

In recent empirical and modeling, Shafto et al. (2012) formalized this
social reasoning process within the framework of Bayesian models of
cognition. In these models, learning is a process of belief updating
that depends on two factors: what the learner believed before seeing the
data and what the learner thinks about the process that generated the
data. The key insight is that if the learner assumes that information is
generated with the intention to communicate/teach, then they can make
``stronger'' inferences.\footnote{Formally, these models change the form
  of the likelihood term in Bayes theorem in order to capture a person's
  theory of how data are generated.}

For example, Goodman, Baker, \& Tenenbaum (2009) presented adults with
causal learning scenarios with the following structure: either the
participant or someone else who knows the causal structure generates an
effect (e.g., growing flowers) by performing two actions at the same
time (e.g., pouring a yellow liquid and a blue liquid). The
participant's task was to identify the correct causal structure. Results
showed that when participants thought the other person was knowledgable,
they were more likely to infer that performing \emph{both} actions was
necessary. In contrast, when the participant performed the action on
their own (and did not know the causal structure), adults were less sure
that both actions were necessary. Shafto et al. (2012) interpreted these
results as learners going through a psychological reasoning process such
as ``if the other person was knowledgeable and wanted to generate the
effect, he would definitely perform both actions if that was the correct
causal structure.''

Similar psychological reasoning effects have been shown in the domains
of word learning (Frank \& Goodman, 2014; Xu \& Tenenbaum, 2007),
selective trust in testimony (Shafto, Eaves, Navarro, \& Perfors, 2012),
tool use (Sage \& Baldwin, 2011), and concept learning (Shafto et al.,
2014). Moreover, there is evidence that even very young learners are
sensitive to the presence of others' goal-directed behaviors. For
example, Yoon et al. (2008) showed that 8-month-olds will encode an
object's identity if their attention was directed by a communicative
point, but they will encode an object's spatial location if their
attention was directed by non-communicative reach. And Senju \& Csibra
(2008) found that infants will follow another person's gaze only if the
gaze event was preceded by the person providing a relevant,
communicative cue (e.g., infant-directed speech or direct eye contact).

Across all of these studies, learners interpreted similar information in
very different ways depending on their assumptions about other people's
goals. These effects are different from the attentional and
informational explanations reviewed above in that the inferences based
on social information are part of the underlying computations that
support learning. This account fits well with evolutionary models that
emphasize the importance of pedagogy for the accumulation of human
cultural knowledge (Boyd et al., 2011; Kline, 2015) and theories of
cognitive development that emphasize the adult's role as providing
children with generalizable information (Csibra \& Gergely, 2009).

\section{Part II: Learning on your
own}\label{part-ii-learning-on-your-own}

Classic theories of development have shared the intuition that knowledge
acquisition is a fundamentally active process where children play a role
in driving their own learning (Berlyne, 1960; Bruner, 1961). Recent
theoretical and empirical work has formalized these intuitions about
``active'' learning by characterizing cognitive development as a process
of active hypothesis testing and theory revision that follows principles
of Bayesian reasoning (Gopnik et al., 1999; Schulz, 2012). Moreover,
work in cognitive science has also modeled active learning as a process
of Bayesian updating with a ``hypothesis-dependent sampling bias'' (D.
B. Markant \& Gureckis, 2014).

The potential benefits of ``active''\footnote{The term ``active
  learning'' has been used to describe a wide variety of behaviors such
  as question asking, increased physical activity, or active memory
  retrieval. In this paper, I focus on a specific subset of these
  behaviors: the \emph{decisions} that people make, or could make,
  during learning. This definition captures several ways that people can
  exert control over their learning experience, including the selection,
  sequencing, and/or pacing of new information.} learning have been the
focus of much recent empirical work in education (Grabinger \& Dunlap,
1995; Prince, 2004), machine learning (Ramirez-Loaiza, Sharma, Kumar, \&
Bilgic, 2017; Settles, 2012), and cognitive science (Castro et al.,
2009; Chi, 2009). The common finding across these studies is that active
learning contexts -- where people have control over some aspect of the
envrionment -- lead to better outcome learning outcomes compared to
passive contexts where people do not have control over the information
they receive from the world. Why does active control lead to better
learning outcomes?

\subsubsection{Active learning enhances attention and
memory}\label{active-learning-enhances-attention-and-memory}

There is a large body of work that directly compares active and passive
learning in a variety of learning domains. In a review of this
literature, D. B. Markant, Ruggeri, Gureckis, \& Xu (2016) suggest that
enhanced memory provides a unified account of the active learning
advantages found across a diverse set of studies. They also point out
that the mechanism through which active control enhances memory depends
on the type of control. The first mechanism is that active control
allows people to coordinate incoming information with their current
cognitive state, including attention and motivation to learn.

One particularly nice illustration of this advantage comes from a study
by D. Markant, DuBrow, Davachi, \& Gureckis (2014). In their experiment,
participants memorized the identities and locations of objects that were
hidden in a grid (adapted from Voss et al. (2011)). D. Markant et al.
(2014) varied the \emph{level} of control across conditions and compared
the performance of active learners to a group of ``yoked'' participants
who saw training data that was generated by the active group. Across
conditions, participants could either control: (a) the next location in
the grid, (b) the next item to be revealed, (c) the duration of each
learning trial, and/or (d) the time between learning trials (i.e.,
inter-stimulus-interval or ISI). Results showed an active learning
advantage for all levels of control, including the lowest amount of
control in the ISI-only condition. D. Markant et al. (2014) interpreted
these results as providing evidence that active control allowed people
to, ``optimize their experience with respect to short-term fluctuations
in their own motivational or attentional state.''

Recent developmental work has extended the active learning advantage for
spatial memory to 6- to 8-year old children (Ruggeri, Markant, Gureckis,
\& Xu, 2016). And other work has found similar benefits of active
control in word learning (partrdige; Kachergis, Yu, \& Shiffrin, 2013)
and understanding causal structures (Schulz, 2012). Moreover, young
infants benefit from active engagement with the environment. Begus,
Gliga, \& Southgate (2014) showed that 16-month-old infants learn better
when information was provided in response to their active pointing
behavior.

Additional evidence that active control enhances attention comes from
work on children's engagement with educational technology (for a review,
see Hirsh-Pasek et al. (2015)). For example, Calvert, Strong, \&
Gallagher (2005) exposed preschool-aged chidren to two sessions of
reading a computer storybook with an adult, and manipulated whether the
adult or the child controlled the mouse, which advanced the story.
Children in the adult-control condition showed a decrease in attention
to the story in the second session; in contrast, children who were given
control over the experience maintained similar levels of attention.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Active learning provides ``good''
information}{Active learning provides good information}}\label{active-learning-provides-good-information}

A second type of benefit of active learning is that it allows people to
gather information that is particularly useful for their own learning.
That is, learners have better access to their own prior knowledge,
current hypotheses, and ability level, which they can leverage to create
more helpful learning contexts (e.g., asking a question about something
that is particularly confusing). This benefit of active learning focuses
on learners' adaptive selection of \emph{content} and relies on a set of
metacognitive monitoring skills that develop over the lifespan.

Recent work in cognitive science and machine learning has aimed to
formally quantify the advantage of active selection of learning content.
For example, Castro et al. (2009) directly compared human active and
passive category learning to predictions from statistical learning
theory under conditions of varying difficulty. They found that human
active learning was always superior to passive learning, but did not
reach the performance of the optimal model and the advantage for active
control decreased in the more difficult (i.e., noisier) learning tasks.

Using a similar approach, D. B. Markant \& Gureckis (2014) investigated
the effects of active vs.~passive hypothesis testing on the rate of
adults' category learning. They varied the difficulty of the learning
task by testing two different types of category structures: a rule-based
category, which varied along 1 dimension (easier to learn), and an
information-integration category, which varied along 2 dimensions
(harder to learn). In the active condition, the learner chose specific
observations from the category to test his or her beliefs, whereas in
passive condition, the data were generated randomly by the experiment.
Participants in the active condition learned the category structure
faster and achieved a higher overall accuracy rate compared to
participants in the passive learning condition, but only for the
simpler, rule-based category.

Studies on the adaptive allocation of study time also speak to the role
of selecting ``good'' information via active control.

The benefits of information selection link nicely to the real-world
learning behavior of question asking. The topic of question asking has
received a lot of attention in developmental psychology.

\subsubsection{What is missing from the active learning
account?}\label{what-is-missing-from-the-active-learning-account}

Active learning in social contexts. The presence of another agent can
change the cost/benefit structure of choices made for learning and
therefore we must include this information in our models of
self-directed learning, which often view the learner as moving back and
forth between active exploration and passive reception. This type of
active learning account does not leave room for social reasoning
processes (i.e., naive utility calculus, goal reasoning) to change the
utility of active learning behaviors.

\section{Part III: Integrating social and active
learning}\label{part-iii-integrating-social-and-active-learning}

Focusing on \emph{choices} is useful since there is a rich literature
that has formalized decision-making process, which can be used to
describe behaviors made by both more knowledgeable others and by
learners. The interesting question is how costs/benefits of active
learning behaviors are altered by the social context and how reasoning
about learners as active might change the social context.

\subsubsection{Parallel formalizations of active and social learning as
rational choice
behavior}\label{parallel-formalizations-of-active-and-social-learning-as-rational-choice-behavior}

There are two points to make here. Active social learning - seek
information from social targets. Models of seeking information from
social targets:

\begin{verbatim}
-  Baldwin & Moses (1998): The Ontogeny of Social Information gathering
-  Chouinard (2007): Children's questions as learning mechanism
-  Hyo's and Liz Bonawitz's work
\end{verbatim}

Active learning takes into account a utility structure that can include
both the costs of data acquisition and the rewards of choosing an
example (e.g., in terms of information acquisition/uncertainty reduction
relative to some longer term learning goal).

Process:

\begin{verbatim}
- analyze costs and benefits of behavior
- planning models that take into account long-term value
- decisions in the brain and in non-human primates 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Models of self-directed learning should include information the
social-communicative context in which learning often occurs. Reasoning
about other people modulate the choices that learners make: whether it's
who to talk to, what to look at, or what questions to ask.

Models of social learning should take into account the choice behaviors
available to the learner. i.e., think about teaching as reasoning about
another person's active learning or setting up a social learning context
where the learner selects actions
