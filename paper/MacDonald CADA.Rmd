# Introduction 

Short version of the entire argument.

### Active learning
### Resource-rational active learning

## Cost-sensitive AI

## Cost-sensitive human learning

## Overview of ecological rationality 

## Review of ecological rational models

# Part 3: Active learning during conversation

## Why should we care about the conversational context?

## What does a converstation look like?

## What behaviors are available? 

### Behavior 1: speaker choice
